All assignments were coded using python, and they are formatted as a .ipynb (ipythonNotebook)
I used google colab to create all of them.

Lab1 : Basic Chatbot & description of environment metrics for different types of Agents
Lab2 : Used networkx to visualize a graph and using Beam Search / BFS to find a specified optimal route
Lab3 : Used Keras and SciKitLearn to create a neural network model 
		that analyzes an image and reports if it detects a dog or a cat
Lab4 : Used Keras and SciKitLearn to create a neural network model that detects
		the type of language used in a tweer and decides what 
		sentiment that language has (positive, neutral, negative)
