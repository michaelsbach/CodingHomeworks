All assignments were coded using python, and they are formatted as a .ipynb (ipythonNotebook)
I used google colab to create all of them.

HW1 : Basic Python (function declarations, accepting input, messing with tuples/sets/lists, etc)
HW2 : More Python (mock of text editor search & replace, removing extra whitespace, etc)
HW3 : Practice with statistics through using basic python to get stats and graphing them 
			(max, min, mean, stddev, percentiles 25, 50, & 75)
HW4 : Practice with numpy library through getting statistics of .txt & analyzing a provided dataset
HW5 : Practice with matplotlib.pyplot (pie, bar, subplots)
HW6 : More practice with matplotlib.pyplot (line, subplots, bar)
